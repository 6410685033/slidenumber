## Objective
This game is a classic puzzle where players rearrange numbered tiles to reach a specific order, typically from 1 to 15 with an empty space. By sliding tiles one at a time, players must solve the puzzle in the least number of moves possible. It provides a fun and challenging way to exercise logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### How to play

- In the beginning, you'll see numbered tiles arranged in seemingly random order, with one empty space.

#### Tips and Strategies: (From Google Gemini)

- Plan your moves: Think ahead and visualize the path required to move each tile to its final position.
- Start with easily movable tiles: Prioritize moving tiles around the empty space to create more options.
- Utilize the empty space: Think of the empty space as a tool to move other tiles around.
- Practice and experiment: The more you play, the better you'll understand the puzzle's mechanics and develop your own strategies.
- Enjoy the challenge! Don't get discouraged if it takes time to solve. The puzzle is designed to be a fun and engaging brain teaser.
